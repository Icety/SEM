        I can sense them already.. Here we go! &#xA;
        We must prepare for our next enemy. &#xA;
        Anyway, there is no time to think about it now, young fighter. &#xA;
        Maybe even dance to it! &#xA;
        our people. Make them sing devilish songs? &#xA;
        imagine what these scary bears would have done to  &#xA;
        would have taken over our planet. I don’t want to  &#xA;
        and their infernal queen Daphne, &#xA;
        these creations of the devil, these Daphnaliens, &#xA;
        Way to go, young SEMian! If it weren’t for you, </story>
